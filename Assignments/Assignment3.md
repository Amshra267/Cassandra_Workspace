Greetings Everyone

With great pleasure, we introduce you to <b>Assignment 3</b> in where you will be applying the Data Processing & Cleaning techniques which we have discussed in the [3rd Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey306uCwVF8). We will be providing you with a <b>Manipulated Dataset</b> and you have to put on your thinking caps to analyse the given dataset carefully and apply all possible cleaning and processing techniques you can think of.

<b> Dataset Description </b>

Dataset comprises of <b>12 columns</b> of which the first <b>11</b> are the features while the last one <b>Target</b> is contains two values 0 and 1. <b>0</b> represents that the Person is <b>not</b> looking for Job change while <b>1</b> indicates that Person is looking for a Job Change.

<b>Instructions</b>

<ol>
    <li>Create a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com">Google Colab</a> or Jupyter Notebook (<code>name_rollno.ipynb</code>)</li>
    <li>Download the given <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OJj1bEREpjtmpXKkTPmxp-zR_zxjR9hd/view?usp=sharing">Dataset</a></li>
    <li>Apply Data Cleaning and Processing Techniques</li>
    <li>Download your Notebook and submit it in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScodnl-qtZ_47giOxEJHRJkWmrLX86mHNaBDeVsjQ86TwA-ug/viewform">Google Form</a></li>
</ol>

<b>IMPORTANT</b> : For every Cleaning and Processing technique you will be applying on the given Dataset, you should add a <b>Comment</b> nearby briefly explaining your <b>Thought Process</b> behind using that particular technique. Also try to make your Notebook interactive by adding <b>Charts & Plots</b> for better visualisation. 

Evaluation of the Assignment will be done on the extent of Cleaning and Processing you have carried out. We will be looking keenly for your ability to understand the various parameters of the dataset and the applicability of the techniques you have implemented while analysing.
