We know that those who encounter data science terminology for the first time technically, will face a situation of overwhelming stuffs. It happened with us as well.</br>
So, we the Caasandra Coordinators will try to treat your wounds :slightly_smiling_face:. We will start in the same process in wich you encounter different terminologies when anyone starts their journey in data science.

### 1. Data Science Languages

Most of us heard that C++, C are very fast languages and used in software developments, In data science speed matters but testing new algorithms fastly matters most, and python and R libraries have an extra edge over C++ due to it's simplicity for fast prototyping hence,

</p>

we will stick with python for testing new algorithms that we need to apply in data science field or specially in this event.

For Python Basics [Awesome lecture series by Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe8XSftW-RAxdo6OmaeL85M)(**first few videos are sufficient for grasping python, later things u will learn while doing**)

### 2. Data Science Tools

IN each stage of cycle a person who is learning data science has to encounter a number of libraries like -

</p>

It is difficult to go through each and every but we will try to cover most of them in a very detailed manner.


#### 2.1 Numpy

This is perhaps the most beautiful and simple library, and contribute to a greater part in python's charm as it is nearly used by everyone who encountered python.

It covers all operations which we can imagine using a multidimensional array.

- Most of the above thing you will forget, it is natural for human brain,
- no one expect that you will memorize everything, 
- just one thing is important that you understand which thing to apply when
- and then google search accordingly.
