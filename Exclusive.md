We are well aware that those who encounter data science terminology for the first time technically are bound to face a situation of overwhelming stuffs. It happened with us as well.</br>
So, we the Caasandra Coordinators will try to treat your wounds :slightly_smiling_face:. We will initiate the same process in wich you should come across different terminologies when anyone begins their journey in the field of Data Science.

### 1. Data Science Languages

Most of us have been introduced to programming languages like C/C++, Java as Fast Languages and used in field of Software Development yet in Data Science speed matters but testing new Algorithms fastly matters the most. Therefore Python and R libraries have an extra edge over C++ due to it's simplicity for fast prototyping hence,

</p>

we will stick with Python for testing new algorithms that we need to apply in Data Science field or specially in this event.

### 2. Data Science Tools

While exploring the world of Data Science, a person comes across numerous libraries like -

</p>

It is difficult to go through each and every library but we will try to cover most of them in a very detailed manner.

#### 2.1 Numpy

This is perhaps the most beautiful and simple library, and contribute extensively in adding charm to Python language as it is nearly used by everyone.

It covers all operations which we can imagine using a multidimensional array.

- Most of the above studd you will tend to forget, it is a natural phenomenon,
- no one expects that you will memorize everything, 
- just one thing is important that you understand which thing to apply when
- and then google search accordingly.
